# SMS Ham & Spam Classification - NLP

This project focuses on classifying SMS messages as either "ham" (non-spam) or "spam" using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset used consists of labeled SMS messages, allowing for the training and evaluation of a machine learning model.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Labeled SMS messages dataset.
- **Classes**: `ham` (non-spam) and `spam`.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing text data by removing noise, such as punctuation and stopwords.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Transforming text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.
3. **Modeling**: Training models like Naive Bayes, SVM, etc., and evaluating performance.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the notebook or script to train and evaluate the model.

## Results
- Best model: Naive Bayes
- Accuracy: 98%
